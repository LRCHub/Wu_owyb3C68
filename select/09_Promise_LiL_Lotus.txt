She said, "Here's my heart, don't break it"
Baby, I'm surprised that I made it
Sometimes I just wonder how we got this far
Don't wanna be apart, I can't take it
Keep you in my arms that's my baby
I'll be there through it all when shit's crazy
I'll be there through it all when shit's crazy

'Cause I know you seen bad things, bad things
But I'll never leave your side and that's the truth
I know you seen bad things, bad things
But everything's alright here with you

I know you seen bad things, bad things
But I'll never leave your side and that's the truth
I know you seen bad things, bad things
But everything's alright here with you

You can have my heart, that's a promise
This everything I ever wanted
Watch the years fly by like a comet
Feel the tears right now, I can't stop it
Feel the tears right now, I can't stop it

'Cause I know you seen bad things, bad things
But I'll never leave your side and that's the truth
I know you seen bad things, bad things
But everything's alright here with you

I know you seen bad things, bad things
But I'll never leave your side and that's the truth
I know you seen bad things, bad things
But everything's alright here with you

I know you seen bad things, bad things
But I'll never leave your side and that's the truth
I know you seen bad things, bad things
But everything's alright here with you

I know you seen bad things, bad things
But I'll never leave your side and that's the truth
I know you seen bad things, bad things
But everything's alright here with you
